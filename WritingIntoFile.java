        Advantages of bw.close()
        1) If you use bw.close(), you remove the unused object, hence you save memory. You can think like my memory is huge,
    not to closing my statement couldn't create any problem. However, since you are going to work maybe 1000 classes,
    after some time, you would get OutOfMemory Error. As you know, OutOfMemory Error cannot be handled. Definitely, it brakes
    your application.
        2) Data Leak .Since you use bw.close(), you removed unused object from your memory, you make your application more secure.
    Because if you don't remove your unused previous object, someone write something in it. Let's just say you have banking project
    unused object is about your ID, or SSN. If somebody reaches it, s/he can use it on his/her behalf.
        3) If you keep many unused objects in your memory, your application runs slower. It decreases the performance of your application.
    As a result, you are less likely to see the advantages of MultiThreading since it is known to improve processing power in lesser time.
